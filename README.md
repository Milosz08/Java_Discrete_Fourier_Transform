## Discrete Fourier Transform Java program

I would like to introduce you to a simple program for computed the Discrete Fourier Transform. The program is based
on a naive algorithm from a simple linear function ax + by = c. The program allows you to generate 0 to N - 1 elements
with different transform values (depending on the input parameter K âˆˆ N - 1).

The program implements the formula:



### About
The input and output of data to and from the program is done using the command line. An interface has been implemented
in the methods that allow displaying, so you can easily implement a graphical interface (created for example in JavaFX
or Swing). The only thing you need to do is to override the interface methods in a separate class controlled by the
graphical environment.

### Compile program

```
$ javac DFT_Algorithm.java
```

or compile using Eclipse or Intelij Idea.
